# Online Examination System (OES)

An online examination system built using the M(MySQL)ERN stack, designed to efficiently manage and conduct exams in an institution. The system supports three roles: Institution Admin, Teacher, and Student, with a System Admin role planned for future development.

## Features

### Institution Admin
- Institution can register and create an admin.
- Admin can manage departments, courses, subjects, students, and teachers.
- Admin can view and monitor exams.

### Teacher
- Teachers can register under their respective institutions.
- Teachers can create both subjective and objective (quiz) type exams.
- Quizzes are auto-graded; subjective questions are manually graded by teachers.
- Teachers can view student details and marks.

### Student
- Students can register under an institution.
- Students can view and attempt exams assigned to them.
- Quiz results are available immediately after the exam; subjective results are available after teacher verification.

### Future Enhancements
- A professional dashboard for result analysis and feature insights for all users.
- A proctoring system 
- Camera is accessed through the exam and detect any malpractice or plagiarisms
- full screen mode
- Ai Based Marking System
- Prevenet Screen Switching
- Face Detection
  

## Security Features

### Authentication
- Secure login system using password hashing with bcrypt.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures only authorized users can access their respective sections.

### OAuth Integration (Future Implementation)
- Google authentication was initially integrated but removed after transitioning away from Firebase.
- OAuth via Clerk or similar services will be added in the future.

### Private Routing
- Reactâ€™s private routing and conditional rendering are used to manage user access to resources.
- Unauthorized or improperly authenticated users are redirected to the login page.

## Development Details

### Password Hashing
- Implemented in `server/server.js` (line 49 onwards).

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Implemented in `client/src/App.jsx` and `client/src/PrivateRoute.js`.

### User Navigation
- After successful login, users are redirected to their respective home pages.
- Handled in `client/src/login/pages/SignIn.jsx`.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Set up MySQL Database**:
   - Import the SQL file from `client/src/config` to create the MySQL database.

2. **Create React Project**:
   - Run the following command to create a Vite React project:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest
     ```
   - Follow the instructions to create the project and clone the repository into it.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In the `client` and `server` directories, run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Running the Project**:
   - Open two terminal windows:
     - In the first terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and run:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```
     - In the second terminal, navigate to the `server` directory and run:
       ```bash
       npm run dev
       ```

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: Bcrypt (for password hashing), OAuth (future integration)

My Project is an online examination system Build using M(MySql)ERN Stack. The project is developed to conduct exams in an institution efficiently. There are basically three roles Institution Admin, Teacher and Student and there will be System Admin role for managing entire project  and that role is currently under development(Not developed yet due to time restrictions ) .This is done as part of my academics(Individual Project). An institution can register in it and create an admin. Institution's admin can add departments, courses, subjects, manage students and teachers and able to see the exams. Teacher register on site under their institution and can create exams both subjective type and objective(Quiz) type Questions. Quiz is auto correct and  subjective type questions is manually corrected by teacher after student attempts the exam. Teacher can view all students details and marks.
Student can register on an institution and able to view and attempt the exams assigned to them. Quiz Result will be available immediately after exam but subjective type questions result will be available after teacher verification.
In future it is decided to add a professional dashboard all users for result analysis and to show their respective feature analysis.

So here there need a secure login system and only authenticated user can access the system and only the right user can access particular links or users can access the sections they are allowed to access that is Role Based Access System.
OAuth is not used in this system as it is not a finished project but will be use in future .At first there is an google authentication system "GoogleAuthProvider" because I first used firebase as database but later realized it is not suitable for this project and removed it so I also removed that feature by removing firebase .But we can implement it using clerk or any other services 
For login security I used password hashing for security . I used bcrypt for hashing .
Here only Authorized users will get access to system and users access the resources they are intent to use. It is implemented by using private routing in React JS and also by conditional rendering. If users is not authenticated or no access to that resources they will be redirected to login page.

If project doesn't run and to validate code :

The password hashing is in server/server.js file's 49th line onwards

RBAC is in App.jsx and PrivateRoute.js in client/src folder

Each user is navigated to their respective home page after successful login .It is in client/src/login/pages/SignIn.jsx file

For running this project

prerequisite:
node
mysql

 create create a vite react project using the command
npm create vite@latest 

then follow the instructions shown on command
clone the repository to the created project 
create a mysql database by importing sql file in the location client>src>config
to run project
create two terminal one for server and one for client
in one terminal 
cd client
npm run dev

in second terminal
cd server
npm run dev
