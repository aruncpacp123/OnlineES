There are mainly three branches
1.Deployment : Used for deploying App
2.Develop : Used for Developing/adding/maintenance
3.Main :Used for checking everything runs perfectly when pushed/merged to deployment branches.Because Main contain currently deployed code and by
        pushing the code firat to main can verify everything work fine with current code.After validating push to deployment

4.Develop2 :  Here we do major changes

Actually all three branches have same code after a deployment.
If we want major changes we can create any branches and also we can deploy from different branches as different versions.
If we want old versions also keep it in another branch and deploy the latest version's branch
